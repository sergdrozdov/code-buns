# Code Buns
Code Buns is a playful collection of reusable boilerplate code written by me, handy snippets and small experimental patterns.

This repository is part of my larger [Buns of Code](https://codebase.blackball.lv/project/code-buns#code-buns) project â€” a personal collection and storage of code that I write and actively use.
It serves as my own toolbox of reusable snippets, boilerplate setups, and small experiments that make building new things faster and more fun.
